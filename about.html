      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I'm a graduate of an Associate Degree of Computer Technology at Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Even though I'm not a BSCS graduate, my passion for learning and keeping up with the latest web technologies will help me keep improving and become a better Web Developer.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>After teaching myself how to code (i.e. while building projects) for more than <strong>5 months</strong>, I have gain enough skills and now looking for a job where I'll work as a Junior Front End Developer (i.e. preferably with some Web Design since I love designing) to further improve my knowledge. Hopefully, I can be a part of your team.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>so what are those skills that I'm talking about?</strong></p>

          <h3>The Fundamentals</h3>

          <img src="img/css3.png" alt="CSS3" />
          <img src="img/js.png" alt="JavaScript" />
          <p>I learned most of the newer semantic elements of <span>HTML5</span>, the difference between a block and inline element, input types, and canvas element.</p>
          <p>With <span>CSS3</span>, I can do heavy styling and animations using keyframes plus responsive design to make websites and web apps that works on different screen sizes.</p>
          <p>And with some <span>JavaScript</span>, I can add some interactivity and also animations that greatly improves user experience. I don't have strong understanding of this yet, but sooner, once I buy good books to read like "Professional JavaScript for web developers" by Nickolas Zakas and "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford, I will have a solid grasp of this programming language (i.e. and of course, its popular frameworks and Libraries such as <span>Angular.Js, Backbone.Js, Ember.Js, JQuery, React.Js</span> etc).</p>

          <h3>Frameworks and Libraries</h3>
          <img src="img/jquery.png" alt="JQuery" />
          <img src="img/foundation.png" alt="Foundation 5" />
          <p>For quick implementation of effects, event handling, DOM traversing and manipulation, I use <span>JQuery</span> since it's already built by expert developers. JQuery is such a nice library as it helps make my work easier, but I don't use it a lot (for now), since I'm focusing on the ins and outs of JavaScript, so that I can understand how JQuery works.</p>
          <p>For building common UI's such as range sliders, buttons and implementing responsive grid system, I use <span>Foundation 5</span>. There's still some components of it that I don't know how to use, but since it's well documented, I think it will be pretty easy to integrate it to a website or web application.</p>

          <h3>CSS Preprocessors</h3>
          <img src="img/sass.png" alt="SASS" title="Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (SASS)" />
          <p>For increasing maintainability of website and web apps I create, I use <span>SASS</span>. I don't have much experience in using this in production so, I want to know more about it on how it can greatly improve my workflow.</p>

          <h3>Other Tools</h3>
          <img src="img/git.png" alt="Git" title="Git for Version Control" />

          <img src="img/devtools.png" alt="Chrome DevTools" title="Chrome DevTools" />
          <p>I know the basic commands of <span>Git</span>, such as <code>init, status, log, add, diff, commit, branch, merge, push, pull</code> and many more. But knowing Git is such a powerful tool, it does not end with just that and that's why I want to learn its advance features and commands utilizing the <span>Terminal</span>.</p>
          <p>With the <span>Chrome DevTools</span>, I can inspect the elements of a webpage, add styles or another element, and fix bugs quickly with the help of the Console. Definitely, I want to learn more about this too.</p>

          <h3>Text Editors</h3>

          <img src="img/brackets.png" alt="Brackets by Adobe" title="Brackets by Adobe" />
          <p>I used <span>Atom</span> before, but since my brother's laptop overheats quickly with it, I switched to <span>Brackets</span> since it's more lightweight. But if I have a powerful machine, I'll prefer Atom over Brackets since, I think, it is more powerful than the other.</p>
